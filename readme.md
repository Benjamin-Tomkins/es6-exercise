# ES6 exercise

The goal of this exercise is to practice some cool ES6 features by doing TDD. This kind of practice is known as [koans](https://alexlobera.com/koans-javascript-and-react/)

To solve this kind of exercise you don't need to know testing, since you won't write any test and the output of the tests will be rendered in the terminal. However, it might be more helpful for some people to look at the test itself to understand what has to be implemented in every case.

## Get started

If you have yarn:
`git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/es6-exercise.git && cd es6-exercise && yarn install`

If you have npm:
`git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/es6-exercise.git && cd es6-exercise && npm install`

## Exercise
- run `npm test` or `yarn test`, by default it will run all the tests.
- We recommend you to start running just one file, some examples:
  - `npm run test -- src/01*` will run just this test 01_destructure.test.js.
  - `npm run test -- src/02*` will run just this test 02_rest-operator.test.js.
  - and so on
- You can fix them in any order, but we recommend you to start from test 01, then 02, and so on.
- Once all the tests pass, you'll be an ES6 expert! :)
